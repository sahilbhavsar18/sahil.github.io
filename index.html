          Storyline
          The Boys is set in a universe in which superpowered people are recognized as heroes by the general public and
          owned by a powerful corporation, Vought International, which ensures that they are aggressively marketed and
          monetized. Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on
          two groups: the titular Boys, vigilantes looking to keep the corrupted heroes under control, and the Seven,
          Vought International's premier superhero team. The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all
          superpowered people, and the Seven are led by the egotistical and unstable Homelander. As a conflict ensues
          between the two groups, the series also follows the new members of each team: Hugh "Hughie" Campbell of the
          Boys, who joins the vigilantes after his girlfriend is killed in a high-speed collision by the Seven's
          A-Train, and Annie January/Starlight of the Seven, a young and hopeful heroine forced to face the truth about
          the heroes she admires Superheroes are often as popular as celebrities, as influential as politicians, and
          sometimes even as revered as gods. But that's when they're using their powers for good. What happens when the
          heroes go rogue and start abusing their powers? When it's the powerless against the super powerful, the Boys
          head out on a heroic quest to expose the truth about the Seven and Vought, the multibillion-dollar
          conglomerate that manages the superheroes and covers up their dirty secrets. Based on the comic book series of
          the same name.The Boys is an American superhero television series developed by Eric Kripke for the streaming
          service Amazon Prime Video. Based on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson,
          which was originally published by DC Comics under its Wildstorm imprint before moving to Dynamite
          Entertainment, it follows the eponymous team of vigilantes as they combat superpowered individuals who abuse
          their abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast that includes Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Laz Alonso, Tomer
          Capon, and Karen Fukuhara as the vigilantes and Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Dominique McElligott, Chace
          Crawford, Jessie T. Usher, and Nathan Mitchell as members of "the Seven", an official superhero group run by
          the conglomerate Vought International who, while maintaining a lofty façade, are shallow celebrity figures
          prone to doing horrendous things in secret.

          The first season premiered on July 26, 2019. Ahead of the second season premiere, the series was renewed for a
          third season in July 2020, which is scheduled to be released on June 3, 2022. The series has received critical
          acclaim for its writing, storyline, humor, and the performances of the cast (particularly Urban and Starr) and
          has been nominated for six Emmy Awards.

          Two spin-off shows were ordered in September 2020 and December 2021, the latter of which, The Boys Presents:
          Diabolical, premiered on March 4.

          Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers.
          Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to
          Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony
          and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast
          including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner,
          Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper,
          Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt
          to reverse the destruction caused by Thanos in Infinity War.

          The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this
          title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the
          script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the
          story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back
          actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in
          Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional
          filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. The
          official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of
          the most expensive films ever made.

          Avengers: Endgame premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April
          26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score,
          action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film
          story. The film grossed $2.798 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just
          eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time
          from July 2019 until March 2021. The film received numerous awards and nominations, including a nomination for
          Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, three nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards (winning
          two), and a nomination for Special Visual Effects at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
